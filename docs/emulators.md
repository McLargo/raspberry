TODO: how to install an emulator, download a rom and play a game

## Installing Emulators

* Set
  up[samba](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/raspberry-pi-samba-file-server)
  I kept same configuration there, I didn't need to change anything. roms is the
  link to connect via interface from outside. Samba server needs to be
  installed in the raspberry, and samba client in computer you want to access
  too (similar to ssh or scp)

* Download roms and copy to correct rom folder. Check if they are installed in
  correct place.

That should be it, no extra steps are required as far as I remember. If anything
change in future installation, edit this file.
